"""Python wrapper around the Tesseract-OCR C++ API

    Accessing data
    ==============

    Coordinate system:

    Integer coordinates are at the cracks between the pixels.
    The top-left corner of the top-left pixel in the image is at (0,0).
    The bottom-right corner of the bottom-right pixel in the image is at
    (width, height).

    Every bounding box goes from the top-left of the top-left contained
    pixel to the bottom-right of the bottom-right contained pixel, so
    the bounding box of the single top-left pixel in the image is:
    (0,0)->(1,1).

    If an image rectangle has been set in the API, then returned coordinates
    relate to the original (full) image, rather than the rectangle.

        You can iterate through the elements of a level using the :func:`iterate_level`
        helper function:
